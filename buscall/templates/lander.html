            <h2>How does it work?</h2> 
            <p>We use information provided by <a href="http://www.nextbus.com">NextBus</a>, which works with public transportation services across the United States. Buses are equipped with GPS tracking systems, which constantly track their location and speed. Based on that information, <a href="http://www.nextbus.com">NextBus</a> can estimate when each bus will arrive at each stop. We check those estimations constantly, and alert you when it's time for you to go.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div id="what-do-i-do" class="faq-entry"> 
            <h2>What do I do?</h2> 
            <p>It's simple! Just log in with your Google account -- no need to remember yet another username and password. Select your bus route, and tell us what time your bus normally arrives. Then tell us when you want to be alerted: for example, we can call you 5 minutes before the bus actually arrives, regardless of how early or late the bus is running. Lastly, put in your phone number so we know how to reach you, and use your PayPal account to activate your alert.</p>
