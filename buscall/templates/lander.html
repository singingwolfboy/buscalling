  <h2>Time management before the coffee kicks in.</h2>

{% block main %}
  <p>Public transportation is a dangerous game when the buses don't follow the schedule. Waiting at the bus stop is boring and uncomfortable -- but waiting at home is inviting disaster. What do you do when the bus rolls by while you're enjoying your morning coffee?</p>

  <p>Relax: we've got your back. Bus Calling tracks your bus <strong>in real time</strong>, so we know if the bus is running early or if it's delayed. We'll <strong>give you a call</strong> (or <em>send you a text!</em>) when the bus is 10 minutes away from your stop, so <strong>you're prepared,</strong> whenever your ride gets there. The bus doesn't follow the schedule -- <em>why should you?</em></p>

  <p>Bus Calling isn't live yet, but you can get on the waitlist now! Just put in your email address and hit that button. (We take privacy seriously: we won't sell or give away your email address to anyone.)</p>
